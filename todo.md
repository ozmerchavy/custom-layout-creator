- add all css props to the form (and maybe style the form a bit)

- in the form, if typeOfSelectedElemet is button,
    above cssprops form we need "text" field
    add reducer: setChildrenToText(string)

- create component called PreviewCode
it will get the tree from redux, generate a string (html string),
and render it inside <pre><code> tags



TO RESOLVE:
- uncontrolled inputs to be controlled
- make unit selector work
- position makes serious issues....
